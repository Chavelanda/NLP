#Introduction
This reposiory contains the two assignments and the project work done for the Natural Language Processing course.
It is dividen in three sections: Assignment 1 (POS), Assignment 2 (QA), Project Work in Human Value Detection. 

#Assignment 1 (POS)
Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a popular NLP
process that consists in marking up every word
in a corpus as corresponding to a particular
part of speech. This assignment aimed at ex-
perimenting with the problem from the prepro-
cessing to the model architectures and error
analysis. This work enabled the use of different
RNN models to effectively perform labeling.
The experimented techniques lead to good re-
sults and allowed a deep understanding of a
simple NLP workflow.

#Assignment 2 (QA)
Generative Question Answering (QA) is a particular task of NLP which aims to creates models and architectures capable of producing answers to given questions in the form of free text. The aim of this assignment is to create
a QA system based on the CoQa dataset by
fine-tuning the distilroberta-base and bertiny
models from Huggingface.

#Project Work in Human Value Detection
Based on the Human Value Detection challenge
2023, this project discusses the implementation
of NLP models capable to classify Human val-
ues on which a specific text relies on. This task
uses a set of 20 value categories compiled from
the social science literature and described in
the paper Identifying the Human Values behind
Arguments (Kiesel et al., 2022).
